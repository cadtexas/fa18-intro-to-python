### Instructions for the programming assignments:
We assigned certain problems in our lesson this week (Week 6) from CodingBat. Please try the questions yourself first before looking at the solutions. If you just want to check your code, the solutions are provided here!

#### Solution Files:
1. `codingbat.py`

If you're not sure where your code went wrong or can't understand an error, be sure to email any of the instructors with your code! They'll be glad to help.
