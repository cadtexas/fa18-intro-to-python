### Instructions for the programming assignments:
You should open all assignments for this week and read the comments on the top. There will be a `test_cases` file for each project as well as a `solution` file. Make sure you test your code before checking the solution file! Remember that a correct function can have multiple ways of being implemented, so don't worry too much if your code doesn't look exactly like ours.

#### Project Files:
1. `p1.py`

#### Test Case Files:
1. `p1_test_cases.py`

#### Solution Files:
1. `p1_solutions.py`

If you're not sure where your code went wrong or can't understand an error, be sure to email any of the instructors with your code! They'll be glad to help.
