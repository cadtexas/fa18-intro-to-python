### Instructions for the programming assignments:
You should open all assignments for this week and read the comments on the top. They should link to an external page that will include a grader (including test cases that you'll be able to look at to debug). We'll also include a solution file that includes a brief explanation for the coded function.

#### Assignment Files:
1. p1.py
2. p2.py

#### Solution Files:
1. p1_solutions.py
2. p2_solutions.py

If you're not sure where your code went wrong or can't understand an error, be sure to email any of the instructors with your code! They'll be glad to help.
