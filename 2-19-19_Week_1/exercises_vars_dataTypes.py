# Exercises with Variables and Data Types:
# 1. Store the value of 17 in a variable.
variable = 17

# 2. is_raining = True
is_raining = True
# a. What data type is is_raining?
type(is_raining) # this line will return that the variable is a Boolean
# b. How can I change this to make is_raining to store false?
is_raining = False

# 3. x = 101
x = 101
# a. Suppose I have a variable y = False. Can I set x = y? What is the new data type of x?
y = False
x = y
type(x)
# b. Now suppose I have a variable var = 17. Can I make x store what var stores? How?
var = 17
x = var
