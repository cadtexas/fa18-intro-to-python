The website also provides an editor for you to use as well as test cases to check your code. Be sure to pass all the test cases and good luck! If you have any questions about your code or the logic in general, you can email any of the instructors (found on our home Github). Be sure to check the solution p2_solutions.py for an efficient solution and compare it to your own!

Here is a hint to solve the problem:
- Function round10(num) - Think about what this function's purpose is. Given an integer 'num', we want to round the number up if the last digit is below 5 and round up otherwise. We can use (num % 10) to get the last digit. You should return the rounded number!

	# You should be calling the method round10(num) once for each parameter


# Make sure to complete the function to help solve the original problem:
def round10(num):
