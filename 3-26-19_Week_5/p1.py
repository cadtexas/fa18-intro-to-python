Week 5: Programming Assignment 1:
The assignment this week is the final exercise on our slides from Week 5. You can access the problem at this link: 
https://codingbat.com/prob/p137202

The website also provides an editor for you to use as well as test cases to check your code. Be sure to pass all the test cases and good luck! If you have any questions about your code or the logic in general, you can email any of the instructors (found on our home Github). Be sure to check the solution p1_solutions.py for an efficient solution and compare it to your own!
