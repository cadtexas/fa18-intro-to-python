### Instructions for the programming assignment:
These instructions can be found on slide 19. Exercise 1 can be found on slide 18.

Starting with a working solution for the first part of the exercise (`exercise_part1.py`) modify it to fit the following requirements:
* The list `squares` should only store odd squares
* If the square of a base is calculated to be even, print it out along with a message (example: "The square of 2 is even!")

If you do not have a working solution for the first part of the exercise, you can use either solution 1 or 2 in `exercise_part1.py`. We recommend that you use solution 1, but either is fine.

The solution will be posted to this repo in about a week.
If you have any questions feel free to email us! Our emails can be found in the readme of the main page.

### Hints
* Use an if-else statement within your for loop
* Use the modulo operator (`%`). The modulo operator allows for you to do remainder division
    * EX1: `5 % 5 = 0`
        * 5 divides evenly into 5. As such, there is no remainder and the expression evaluates to 0.
    * EX2: `5 % 2 == 1`
        * 2 doesn't divide evenly into 5. As such, there is a remainder of 1.
* By doing `% 2` on any number we can determine if it is odd or even
    * number % 2 == 1 (number is odd)
    * number % 2 == 0 (number is even)
