### Instructions for the programming assignments:
You should download all assignments plus the grader and run them in your IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code). Once you are done modifying the code, you can run it on your terminal. Don't change any lines of code unless it says to.

#### How to run your code:
You can run the code on your terminal by typing:
python p1.py
python p2.py

The terminal should return descriptive messages on how you did.
